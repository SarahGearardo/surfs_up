## Overview of Analysis<br>
The purpose of this analysis was to generate weather data on the island of Oahu in Hawaii. We want to open a surf and shake shop with an investor, W. Avy, however, their first surf shop they opened had to go out of business due to inclimate weather in the area. If we can determine that the temprature is up and the precipitation levels are down, he is more likely to back us in our venture.<br>

## Results<br>

## Summary<br>
By looking at temprature data in June and in December, we can see where the tempratures are at the beginning of summer and the start of winter. In June, the temprature is starting to warm up, but the mean temprature is only a few degrees off from what it is in December. The minimum temprature varies by ten degrees, which is a lot, especially when you are by the water. Due to this, it may be wise to make our hours shorter in December as people will not be wanting ice cream if the temprature dips. <br>

One of the additional data sets I would like to see is the precipitation for both June and December. I would expect there to be more precipitation in December as the tempratures get cooler and I expect the opposite in June (less precipitation with warming tempratures). If we can confirm this, or find out something not expected, we could adjust our hours to accomidate. <br>

I think elevation would also be a good data set to explore. Does it make a different in temprature and precipitation in elevated locations? With the surf and shake shop, we would want to stick close to the beach, but if we could find difference in elevations on that beach, it could determine where the building is built.
